# The CCP Connection Database (T-SQL)
This is a proof of concept database and set of stored procedures for The CCP Connection Web App. I first created an Entity Relationship Diagram, normalizing the database so that each table represented only one object of the final app. I then used T-SQL to build the database, tables, key constraints, and many stored procedures to join data into new views that would need to be rendered in the final web app.
